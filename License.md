If ya steal muh code, just make sure you credit the part of the code you stole as mine and link to muh GitHubz.

If ya make one of them forkz, make sur you add to the Readme that this is a forkz of "https://github.com/KingFredrickVI/gHalo" with at least 1 picture of a cat eating cookies (but you should already have at least 3 of those in your repo ;) ).

(1) If you make a fork, you are not allowed to charge money for access to your fork or sell your forked version without express permission from the developers.

(2) You are not allowed to charge money for access to this repo or reupload/repost this repo to any website and sell for monetary gain in any way.

Please note that for (1) and (2) this only refers to the code -directly-. If you make a fork and make some awesome changes (or not) and want to upload it to your amazing private server that you charge over $9,000 to play on, you are not breaking (1) nor (2).
